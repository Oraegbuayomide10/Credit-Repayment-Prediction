## Introduction

This post describes how I used the Xgboost library to create a machine learning model that predicts PAYGo SHS contract repayments or defaults. I used various engineering techniques. I used this pipeline to enter Zindiâ€™s [SFC PAYGo Solar Credit Repayment Competition](https://zindi.africa/competitions/sfc-paygo-solar-credit-repayment-competition).

# Summary of Approach

# Data Enginnering & Transformation

. Measures of Central Tendency 

. DateTime

. One Hot Encoding

. Correlation Analysis


# Common Configuration

. XgBoost Feature importance 

. Early Stopping Rounds

. Cross Validation
